           <b> “How to learn CSS”</b> <p>

I think the cheat sheet part was really interesting. I understand that it’s okay to copy code when you don’t know something, but what I’ve realized is that you learn it or parts of it when you first write it down. This is something I find helpful for me in my work. <p>



<b>“About low tech magazine’s solar powered websites”</b> <p>

This probably sound ridiculous, but it never occurred to me that websites take up energy. I always thought it was the obvious electricity that the computer need to work. I found this article so interesting and eye opening because when people think about protecting the environment or saving it, I think technology is looked at like a messiah. But what people (like myself) don’t understand is that every little change makes a difference. I will definitely reconsider the aspect of how design should be created and be more cautious of my work from now on. <p>

<b> “Accessibility according to actual people with disabilities”</b> <p>

When designing anything, the group of people you’re going to affect isn’t as much of a “group” but more of a range of people with and without certain abilities or accessibility. I don’t believe that the same thing can relate to everyone but its nice to have considered as many people during the design process. I think when we design we attribute our “target audience” to have similar tastes and abilities to us. Whether it’s trends or aesthetics, it still is some sort or a partiality or preference. This is something I hope to do less of in my work. <p>
            
            <b> “What We Mean When We Say “responsive””</b> <p>
            Before reading this article, I thought that the term "responsive" had only one meaning or one definition. I believed that it was a different concept and what I later learned was that Web Design is the same thing when done thoughtfully. "Responsive" design is something that is discussed so widely and it just seems like this whole other entity which then brings us full circle. "...Will it achieve such dominance that the adjective itself will fade over time and disappear like a vestigial tail, leaving us simply…web design?" <p>
            
             <b> “What Happens When You Create A Flexbox Flex Container?”</b> <p>
            I enjoyed how informative this article was and what I appreciated the most was that it had snippets code for each of the explanations. My only question is why do you need CSS grids when a flexbox has a CROSS-AXIS ALIGNMENT? <p>
            
             <b> “Kameelah Janan Rasheed on research and archiving”</b> <p>
            This reading helped consolidate the idea of learning through research. When you try to look for answers, you come across so many more questions along the way and vice-versa. In a way, it changes your perspective on a lot of things and the ways in which you understand them. <p>
           
             <b> “Rutherford Chang on the art of collection”</b> <p>
            “…told the stories of where it’s been—and that they’d all be these unique objects.” 
I love this quote by Chang. I think this applies to everything around us. Every object, big or small tells us a story. I don’t believe that two things can be completely identical. In the article, research is perfectly summarized as “It’s just what’s involved in making it happen” and this then transforms into a collection. <p>
            
            <b> “Ordinary plenty”</b> <p>
            “My words might not be as important as the great works of print that have survived thus far, but because they are digital, and because they are online, they can and should be preserved …along with all the millions of other words by millions of other historical nobodies like me out there on the web.” This I believe is the main reason to collect things online because they can be preserved for a long time. Time transcends us and this is the best way to preserve collections. <p>
