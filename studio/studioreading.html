           <b> “My website is a shifting house”</b> <p>

I really like the fact that she took something we consider technical or technological (like files on a computer) and divided it into more organic concepts like plants and gardens. The metaphors continued through the article, and this made me wonder where she was going with it. The quote “Metaphor unites reason and imagination” made me grasp the context of the article. 
<p>
 

Another aspect of this article I enjoyed was the fact that she introduced the idea of multiple tries. She mentioned websites could be thrown into the ocean like rocks. This part motivated me a little and helped me understand that there are no bad ideas, just multiple ones.  <p>



<b>“Exercises in style”</b> <p>

This reading reinforced the fact that one story can be told and interpreted in multiple ways. It's all about the perspective. The story itself seems so insignificant but it is written so brilliantly and it definitely takes a lot of talent for someone to tell one completely unremarkable story 99 times and still make a fun and readable book out of it. <p>

<b> “Skin, scroll, stare”</b> <p>

I think websites blur the lines between artists and designers. It’s not just about the content anymore, but also the presentation. Could a designer be called an artist and vice versa? Websites are very technical, but without an artistic voice, it does not reflect its intentions or purpose. <br> 
I believe the purpose of a website is to communicate, and the purpose of an artist or designer is to do the same. Technology has the widest reach when it comes to spreading messages or content and it is the perfect platform to curate art.
