           <b> “My website is a shifting house”</b> <p>

I really like the fact that she took something we consider technical or technological (like files on a computer) and divided it into more organic concepts like plants and gardens. The metaphors continued through the article, and this made me wonder where she was going with it. The quote “Metaphor unites reason and imagination” made me grasp the context of the article. 
<p>
 

Another aspect of this article I enjoyed was the fact that she introduced the idea of multiple tries. She mentioned websites could be thrown into the ocean like rocks. This part motivated me a little and helped me understand that there are no bad ideas, just multiple ones.  <p>



<b>“Exercises in style”</b> <p>

This reading reinforced the fact that one story can be told and interpreted in multiple ways. It's all about the perspective. The story itself seems so insignificant but it is written so brilliantly and it definitely takes a lot of talent for someone to tell one completely unremarkable story 99 times and still make a fun and readable book out of it. <p>

<b> “Skin, scroll, stare”</b> <p>

I think websites blur the lines between artists and designers. It’s not just about the content anymore, but also the presentation. Could a designer be called an artist and vice versa? Websites are very technical, but without an artistic voice, it does not reflect its intentions or purpose. <br> 
I believe the purpose of a website is to communicate, and the purpose of an artist or designer is to do the same. Technology has the widest reach when it comes to spreading messages or content and it is the perfect platform to curate art. <p>
            
<b> "Research and Destroy: A Plea for Design as Research"</b><p>
            Aristotle once said that the soul never thinks without an image. I believe that design creates not only images, but lasting impressions on the world around us and the society we live in. We have more people predicting the future when we need people creating it. <br> 
            I think failed design leads to more improvement. As designers, it’s our job to fail multiple times, because otherwise, it’s not hard work. The entire world is a prototype and everyday is a different version. Flaws in design come about when a people feel excluded. “No. I don’t think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed it, Chewie” said Han Solo to Chewbacca about the Tydirium imperial shuttle they were flying in the movie Star Wars. Well, if all design was great design, we would not have many moments where we laugh. <p>
            
            <b> "A Handmade Web"</b><p>
            I think that in the world today, everything can be done with a machine. This makes everything around us whether it be a tangible object or an emotion seem so impersonal. <br>
            "I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a 'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run." I liked these lines the most because computers were made to follow a program that people made, and now we lead our lives following a computer program.
            <p> 
                
              <b> "Can Memes Bring Down the Government?"</b><p>
           I think memes have become a huge cultural phenomenon with this generation. Freedom of speech has trancended into this meme culture where everything is turned into a funny reference or joke. It sounds like it's a bad joke, but in actuality it's one of the smartest ways in which information is spread and discussed on a large platform. When it comes to the design aspect of it, I think that it has manifested into a category of its own with the "bad" layout and typography. 
            <p> 
            
              <b> "A Note on the Time"</b><p>
           The most interesting part of this artcle was the Ponzi scheme comparison. I think it's a really funny way to put it because we've built a structure around something that cannot be contained. So when you think about it, you will find that you're giving people this empty box in a way and promising something that's not there. Moreover, I believe that time cannot be precise and is forever in flux and so the quote "We might all agree that 2012 Oct 9:58 AM identifies one specific Point in time, a forever unrepeatable instant that disappears as quickly as we can stamp it." so perfectly explains why.

                <b> "Designing Programmes"</b><p>
          This reading in a way questions whether design is something more than the form. It is an interesting point of view because typography is in itself a design which embodies a particular form but when you look at a typogram, the form is its own design. Typography is just letterforms to represent a language but has the potential to be a great graphic if allowed to do so. It creates a way of not just reading the lines, but also reading between the lines.
