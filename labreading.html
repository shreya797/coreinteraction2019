           <b> “How to learn CSS”</b> <p>

I think the cheat sheet part was really interesting. I understand that it’s okay to copy code when you don’t know something, but what I’ve realized is that you learn it or parts of it when you first write it down. This is something I find helpful for me in my work. <p>



<b>“About low tech magazine’s solar powered websites”</b> <p>

This probably sound ridiculous, but it never occurred to me that websites take up energy. I always thought it was the obvious electricity that the computer need to work. I found this article so interesting and eye opening because when people think about protecting the environment or saving it, I think technology is looked at like a messiah. But what people (like myself) don’t understand is that every little change makes a difference. I will definitely reconsider the aspect of how design should be created and be more cautious of my work from now on. <p>

<b> “Accessibility according to actual people with disabilities”</b> <p>

When designing anything, the group of people you’re going to affect isn’t as much of a “group” but more of a range of people with and without certain abilities or accessibility. I don’t believe that the same thing can relate to everyone but its nice to have considered as many people during the design process. I think when we design we attribute our “target audience” to have similar tastes and abilities to us. Whether it’s trends or aesthetics, it still is some sort or a partiality or preference. This is something I hope to do less of in my work. <p>
            
            <b> “What We Mean When We Say “responsive””</b> <p>
            Before reading this article, I thought that the term "responsive" had only one meaning or one definition. I believed that it was a different concept and what I later learned was that Web Design is the same thing when done thoughtfully. "Responsive" design is something that is discussed so widely and it just seems like this whole other entity which then brings us full circle. "...Will it achieve such dominance that the adjective itself will fade over time and disappear like a vestigial tail, leaving us simply…web design?" <p>
            
             <b> “What Happens When You Create A Flexbox Flex Container?”</b> <p>
            I enjoyed how informative this article was and what I appreciated the most was that it had snippets code for each of the explanations. My only question is why do you need CSS grids when a flexbox has a CROSS-AXIS ALIGNMENT? <p>
